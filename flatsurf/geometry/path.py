Paths on surfaces

A path on a surface is a sequence of compatible
:class:`flatsurf.geometry.segment.Segment straight line segments`, i.e., such
that the end point of one segment is the start point of the next segment.

EXAMPLES::

    sage: from flatsurf import translation_surfaces, Path

    sage: S = translation_surfaces.square_torus()
    sage: p = Path(S, [S.segment(S(0, 0), (1, 0)), S.segment(S(0, 1), (0, 1)), S.segment(S(0, 2), (-1, 0)), S.segment(S(0, 3), (0, -1))])
    sage: p
    [Vertex 0 of polygon 0 to +(1, 0), Vertex 1 of polygon 0 to +(0, 1), Vertex 2 of polygon 0 to +(-1, 0), Vertex 3 of polygon 0 to +(0, -1)]
