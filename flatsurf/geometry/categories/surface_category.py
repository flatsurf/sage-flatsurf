Category types for surfaces.

This module provides alternative implementations for the SageMath types
``Category`` and ``CategoryWithAxiom``. It patches the ``_cmp_key`` of these
types to produce a more stable sorting of surface categories exactly in the
same way that SageMath does for its builtin categories.

Without this, the MRO of surfaces is session dependent and in particular we get
somewhat random printing of categories such as translation surfaces.

While we do not claim to actually understand all the details here, you can
consult ``c3_controlled.py`` in SageMath for all the (rather technical)
details.
