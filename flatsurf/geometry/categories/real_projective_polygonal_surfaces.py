r"""
The category of surfaces built by gluing Euclidean polygons.

See :mod:`flatsurf.geometry.categories` for a general description of the
category framework in sage-flatsurf.

Normally, you won't create this (or any other) category directly. The correct
category is automatically determined for surfaces.

EXAMPLES::

    sage: from flatsurf import Surface_dict
    sage: C = Surface_dict(QQ).category()

    sage: from flatsurf.geometry.categories import RealProjectivePolygonalSurfaces
    sage: C.is_subcategory(RealProjectivePolygonalSurfaces())
    True
