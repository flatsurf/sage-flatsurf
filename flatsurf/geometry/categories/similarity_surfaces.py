r"""
The category of similarity surfaces.

This provides shared functionality for all surfaces in sage-flatsurf that are
built from Euclidean polygons that are glued by similarities, i.e., identified
edges can be transformed into each other by application of rotation and
scaling.

See :mod:`flatsurf.geometry.categories` for a general description of the
category framework in sage-flatsurf.

Normally, you won't create this (or any other) category directly. The correct
category is automatically determined for surfaces.

EXAMPLES::

    sage: from flatsurf import Surface_dict
    sage: C = Surface_dict().category()

    sage: from flatsurf.geometry.categories.similarity_surfaces import SimilaritySurfaces
    sage: C.is_subcategory(SimilaritySurfaces())
    True
