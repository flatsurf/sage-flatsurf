r"""
The category of surfaces built by gluing hyperbolic polygons.

See :mod:`flatsurf.geometry.categories` for a general description of the
category framework in sage-flatsurf.

Normally, you won't create this (or any other) category directly. The correct
category is automatically determined for immutable surfaces.

EXAMPLES::

    sage: from flatsurf import MutableOrientedHyperbolicSurface, HyperbolicPlane
    sage: H = HyperbolicPlane(QQ)
    sage: C = MutableOrientedHyperbolicSurface(H).category()

    sage: from flatsurf.geometry.categories import HyperbolicPolygonalSurfaces
    sage: C.is_subcategory(HyperbolicPolygonalSurfaces())
    True
