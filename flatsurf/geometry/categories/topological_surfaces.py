r"""
The category of topological surfaces.

This provides a base category for all the surfaces in sage-flatsurf.

See :mod:`flatsurf.geometry.categories` for a general description of the
category framework in sage-flatsurf.

Normally, you won't create this (or any other) category directly. The correct
category is automatically determined for surfaces.

EXAMPLES::

    sage: from flatsurf import Surface_dict
    sage: C = Surface_dict().category()

    sage: from flatsurf.geometry.categories.topological_surfaces import TopologicalSurfaces
    sage: C.is_subcategory(TopologicalSurfaces())
    True

    The category of topological surfaces.

    This category does not provide much functionality but just a common base
    for all the other categories defined in sage-flatsurf.

    In particular, this does not really require a topology since there is no
    general concept of open subsets of a surface in sage-flatsurf.

    EXAMPLES::

        sage: from flatsurf.geometry.categories.topological_surfaces import TopologicalSurfaces
        sage: TopologicalSurfaces()
