The category of topological surfaces.

This module provides a base category for all surfaces in sage-flatsurf.

See :mod:`flatsurf.geometry.categories` for a general description of the
category framework in sage-flatsurf.

Normally, you won't create this (or any other) category directly. The correct
category is automatically determined for immutable surfaces.

EXAMPLES::

    sage: from flatsurf import MutableOrientedSimilaritySurface
    sage: S = MutableOrientedSimilaritySurface(QQ)

    sage: from flatsurf.geometry.categories import TopologicalSurfaces
    sage: S in TopologicalSurfaces()
    True

class TopologicalSurfaces(SurfaceCategory):

    The category of topological surfaces, i.e., surfaces that are locally
    homeomorphic to the real plane or the closed upper half plane.

    This category does not provide much functionality but just a common base
    for all the other categories defined in sage-flatsurf.

    In particular, this does not require a topology since there is no general
    concept of open subsets of a surface in sage-flatsurf.

    EXAMPLES::

        sage: from flatsurf.geometry.categories import TopologicalSurfaces
        sage: TopologicalSurfaces()

        Return the categories a topological surface is also a member of.

        """

        def refined_category(self):
            r"""
            Return the smallest subcategory that this surface is in.

            The result of this method can be fed to ``_refine_category_`` to
            change the category of the surface (and enable functionality
            specific to the smaller classes of surfaces.)

            Note that this method does have much effect for a general
            topological surface. Subcategories and implementations of surfaces
            should override this method to derive more features.

            category automatically.

                We do not specify the interface of such mutations. Any mutable
