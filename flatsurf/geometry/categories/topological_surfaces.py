r"""
The category of topological surfaces.

This provides a base category for all the surfaces in sage-flatsurf.

See :mod:`flatsurf.geometry.categories` for a general description of the
category framework in sage-flatsurf.

Normally, you won't create this (or any other) category directly. The correct
category is automatically determined for surfaces.

EXAMPLES::

    sage: from flatsurf import Surface_dict
    sage: C = Surface_dict(QQ).category()

    sage: from flatsurf.geometry.categories import TopologicalSurfaces
    sage: C.is_subcategory(TopologicalSurfaces())
    True

class TopologicalSurfaces(SurfaceCategory):
    r"""
    The category of topological surfaces, i.e., surfaces that are locally
    homeomorphic to the real plane or the closed upper half plane.

    This category does not provide much functionality but just a common base
    for all the other categories defined in sage-flatsurf.

    In particular, this does not really require a topology since there is no
    general concept of open subsets of a surface in sage-flatsurf.

    EXAMPLES::

        sage: from flatsurf.geometry.categories import TopologicalSurfaces
        sage: TopologicalSurfaces()
        Category of topological surfaces

    class ParentMethods:
        def refined_category(self):
            r"""
            Return the smallest subcategory that this surface is in.

            The result of this method can be fed to ``_refine_category_`` to
            change the category of the surface (and enable functionality
            specific to the smaller classes of surfaces.)

            Note that this method does have much effect for a general
            topological surface. Subcategories and implementations of surfaces
            should override this method to derive more features.
