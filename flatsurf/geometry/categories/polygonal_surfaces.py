r"""
The category of surfaces built from polygons.

This provides shared functionality for all surfaces in sage-flatsurf that are
built from polygons (such as Euclidean polygons or hyperbolic polygons.)

See :mod:`flatsurf.geometry.categories` for a general description of the
category framework in sage-flatsurf.

Normally, you won't create this (or any other) category directly. The correct
category is automatically determined for surfaces.

EXAMPLES::

    sage: from flatsurf import Surface_dict
    sage: C = Surface_dict(QQ).category()

    sage: from flatsurf.geometry.categories.polygonal_surfaces import PolygonalSurfaces
    sage: C.is_subcategory(PolygonalSurfaces())
    True

    The category of surfaces built by gluing polygons defined in some space
    such as the projective plane (see
