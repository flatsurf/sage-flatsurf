r"""
The category of dilation surfaces.

This provides shared functionality for all surfaces in sage-flatsurf that are
built from Euclidean polygons that are glued by translation followed by
homothety, i.e., application of a diagonal matrix.

See :mod:`flatsurf.geometry.categories` for a general description of the
category framework in sage-flatsurf.

Normally, you won't create this (or any other) category directly. The correct
category is automatically determined for surfaces.

EXAMPLES::

    sage: from flatsurf import polygons, similarity_surfaces
    sage: P = polygons(vertices=[(0,0), (2,0), (1,4), (0,5)])
    sage: S = similarity_surfaces.self_glued_polygon(P)
    sage: C = S.category()

    sage: from flatsurf.geometry.categories.dilation_surfaces import DilationSurfaces
    sage: C.is_subcategory(DilationSurfaces())
    True
