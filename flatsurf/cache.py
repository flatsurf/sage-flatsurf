r"""
Adapts :mod:`sage.misc.cachefunc` for sage-flatsurf.

Some methods on surfaces in sage-flatsurf benefit a lot from caching. However,
we cannot simply put ``@cached_method`` on these surfaces since they are often
defined in a class that is used by both, mutable and immutable surfaces.
Caching for mutable surfaces would be incorrect, or we would have to manually
clear caches upon mutation.

Therefore, we add a decorator ``@cached_surface_method`` that only caches if
the surface is immutable.

EXAMPLES::

    sage: from flatsurf import MutableOrientedSimilaritySurface, translation_surfaces
    sage: S = MutableOrientedSimilaritySurface.from_surface(translation_surfaces.square_torus())
    sage: S.edge_matrix(0, 0) is S.edge_matrix(0, 0)
    False

When we call
:meth:`flatsurf.geometry.surface.MutablePolygonalSurface.set_immutable`,
caching is enabled for this method::

    sage: S.set_immutable()
    sage: S.edge_matrix(0, 0) is S.edge_matrix(0, 0)
    True
