sage-flatsurf
=============

This is a software package for working with flat surfaces in `SageMath`_.
For the documentation, see the Links section below.

We aim for this package to support the investigation of geometric, algebraic and
dynamical questions related to flat surfaces. By flat surface we mean a surface
modeled on the plane with monodromy given by similarities of the plane, though
current efforts are focused on translation surfaces and half-translation
surfaces.

Currently, the package can:

- generate images of flat surfaces

- compute and plot straight-line trajectories

- deform translation surfaces through the GL(2,R) action and
  compute GL(2,R)-orbit closures (the latter requires `libflatsurf`_)

- compute Delaunay decompositions.

`SageMath`_, `e-antic`_ and `exact-real`_ are used to perform exact arithmetic.

This package is free software, released under the GPL v2 (see the ``COPYING``
file). We welcome any help to improve the package and especially to broaden
the package's mathematical abilities.

The package is currently in active development. If you would like assistance
in using it, please contact the authors.

Dependencies
------------

- `surface-dynamics`_
- (optional) `libflatsurf`_

Installing the package
----------------------

Since sage-flatsurf is available on PyPI (see Links section above),
the released version of sage-flatsurf can be installed by running the following command::

    $ sage --pip install sage-flatsurf [--user] [--upgrade]

To install the development version of sage-flatsurf, run instead::

    $ sage --pip install git+https://github.com/flatsurf/sage-flatsurf [--user] [--upgrade]

The options ``--user`` and ``--upgrade`` are optional; ``--user`` is to
perform the installation in your user home instead of in the Sage sources;
``--upgrade`` is to upgrade the package in case it is already installed.

This might fail if `Git <https://git-scm.com/>`_ is not installed on your
computer (which could happen for example with certain versions of Sage in Windows).
In this situation you have two options. Either you install Git. Or you download
this project from the "Clone or download" drop-down menu above (you should get
a zip file). Then you need to run the command::

    $ sage --pip install TARBALL_NAME [--user] [--upgrade]

where ``TARBALL_NAME`` has to be replaced with the full path to your tarball.
Under Windows, it should be a Cygwin path and will look something like
``/cygdrive/c/Users/You/Downloads/sage-flatsurf-master.zip``.

Then you should be able to use the following within Sage::

    sage: import flatsurf.geometry.similarity_surface_generators as sfg
    sage: T = sfg.translation_surfaces.regular_octagon()
    sage: T
    Translation surface built from 1 polygon
    sage: T.stratum()
    H_2(2)

To uninstall the package, you can do::

    $ sage --pip uninstall flatsurf

Run the tests
-------------

Running the tests of a specific file or directory is done by running::

    $ sage -t --force-lib ARG

where ``ARG`` is either a directory or file. In particular, to test all the
files in the module just do::

    $ sage -t --force-lib flatsurf

Related projects
----------------

There are several related projects

* `surface-dynamics`_ (SageMath module): more focused on dynamics (interval
  exchanges)

* `veerer`_ (Python module): to handle specific triangulations of
  half-translation surfaces

* `libflatsurf`_: (C++ library with Python interface) computing GL(2,R)-orbit
  closures of translation surfaces

* `curver`_ (Python module): computation in the curve complex and the mapping
  class group
