sage-flatsurf Change Log
========================

.. current developments

v0.4.6
====================

**Performance:**

* Improved acting with a matrix on a polygon by not checking convexity of the result.



v0.4.5
====================

**Fixed:**

* Fix determining base ring in `from_pyflatsurf` when importing surfaces from pyflatsurf.
* Include orbit closure module in documentation at https://flatsurf.github.io/sage-flatsurf.

**Performance:**

* Improved performance of erasing marked points by Delaunay triangulating first.



v0.4.4
====================

**Changed:**

* Got rid of the FlowDecomposition wrapper in gl2r_orbit_closure.py.

**Performance:**

* Improved performance of rank computations when computing orbit closures by
  using a faster algorithm for residue fields, see
  https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/33273.



v0.4.3
====================

**Added:**

* Added another example of an explicit orbit closure computation to the documentation.
* Added better error messages when an optional dependency is not installed,
  pointing out how this dependency could be satisfied.

**Changed:**

* The `copy` parameter of `Surface_list.__init__()` and
  `__Surface_dict.__init__()` now defaults to `surface.is_mutable()`. Before
  the default was `True`. However, in principle this should not break any
  existing code but only change the runtime slightly in some cases.

* The `mutable` parameter of `Surface_list.__init__()` and
  `Surface_dict.__init__()` now defaults to `True`. Before its default was
  `False` in many cases. This change might break some existing code. If it
  does, one needs to either explicitly set `mutable=False` in this invocation or
  call `surface.set_immutable()`.

**Removed:**

* Removed the `unused/` directory which held a collection of unused code that was moved there in 2016.

**Fixed:**

* Fixed some issues in documentation of Surface classes and simplified some of their implementation.

* Fixed typos that lead to runtime errors in rare cases.

**Performance:**

* Improved performance of polygon constructions such as `triangle(26, 48, 75)`.



v0.4.2
====================

**Fixed:**

* Adapted to type changes in pyflatsurf 3.7.0.



v0.4.1
====================

**Performance:**

* Speed up kernel and rank computations when computing orbit closures.



v0.4.0
====================
