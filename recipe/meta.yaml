  summary: Flat Surfaces in SageMath
  description: |
    This module supports the investigation of geometric, algebraic and
    dynamical questions related to flat surfaces. By flat surface we mean a
    surface modeled on the plane with monodromy given by similarities of the
    plane, though current efforts are focused on translation surfaces and
    half-translation surfaces.
