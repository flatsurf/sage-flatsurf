<h1><p align="center">sage-flatsurf</p></h1>

sage-flatsurf is a Python package for working with flat surfaces in
[SageMath](https://sagemath.org).

We aim for sage-flatsurf to support the investigation of geometric, algebraic
and dynamical questions related to flat surfaces. By flat surface we mean a
surface modeled on the plane with monodromy given by similarities of the plane,
though current efforts are focused on [translation
surfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_surface) and
[half-translation
surfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_surface#Half-translation_surfaces).

Please consult our [documentation](https://flatsurf.github.io/sage-flatsurf/)
to see some of the capabilities of sage-flatsurf.

sage-flatsurf is free software, released under the [GPL v2 (or later)](./COPYING).

We welcome any help to improve sage-flatsurf. If you would like to help, have
ideas for improvements, or if you need any assistance in using sage-flatsurf,
please don't hesitate to [contact us](https://flatsurf.github.io#contact).
