sage-flatsurf: Flat Surfaces in SageMath
========================================

sage-flatsurf is a Python package for working with flat surfaces in `SageMath
<https://sagemath.org>`.

We aim for sage-flatsurf to support the investigation of geometric, algebraic
and dynamical questions related to flat surfaces. By flat surface we mean a
surface modeled on the plane with monodromy given by similarities of the plane,
though current efforts are focused on `translation surfaces
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_surface>`_ and `half-translation
surfaces
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_surface#Half-translation_surfaces>`_.
