# Defining Surfaces

## Built in surfaces

Veech's double n-gon surfaces:

```{code-cell}
from flatsurf import translation_surfaces

s = translation_surfaces.veech_double_n_gon(5)
s.plot()
```

The Arnoux-Yoccoz surface of arbitrary genus is built in:

```{code-cell}
s = translation_surfaces.arnoux_yoccoz(3)
s.plot()
```

Chamanara's infinite translation surface:

```{code-cell}
s = translation_surfaces.chamanara(1 / 2)
```

```{code-cell}
s.plot(polygon_labels=False, edge_labels=False)
```

```{code-cell}
s = translation_surfaces.infinite_staircase()
```

```{code-cell}
s.plot()
```

## Billiard tables

```{code-cell}
from flatsurf import similarity_surfaces, Polygon

s = similarity_surfaces.billiard(Polygon(vertices=[(0, 0), (3, 0), (0, 4)]))
```

```{code-cell}
s.plot()
```

## Minimal translation surface covers

Continuing the billiard example above, we get an infinite translation surface below:

```{code-cell}
ss = s.minimal_cover(cover_type="translation")
```

```{code-cell}
gs = ss.graphical_surface()
```

```{code-cell}
gs.make_all_visible(limit=12)
```

```{code-cell}
gs.plot()
```

## Building surfaces from polygons

This defines a regular 12-gon with algebraic real coordinates (AA) with first vector given by (1,0):

```{code-cell}
from flatsurf import polygons

p0 = polygons.regular_ngon(12, field=AA)
p1 = polygons.regular_ngon(3, field=AA)
```

```{code-cell}
p0.plot() + p1.plot()
```

The vertices of n-gons are numbered by $\{0,...,n-1\}$, with the $0$-th vertex at the origin. Edge $i$ joins vertex $i$ to vertex $i+1 \pmod{n}$.

We can act on polygon with $2 \times 2$ matrices. We define the rotation by $\frac{\pi}{6}$ below:

```{code-cell}
R = matrix(AA, [[cos(pi / 6), -sin(pi / 6)], [sin(pi / 6), cos(pi / 6)]])
show(R)
```

```{code-cell}
R * p1
```

Define a surface over the field <code>AA</code> of algebraic reals.

```{code-cell}
from flatsurf import MutableOrientedSimilaritySurface

surface = MutableOrientedSimilaritySurface(AA)
```

Add two polygons to the surface with labels 0 and 1:

```{code-cell}
surface.add_polygon(p0, label=0)
```

```{code-cell}
surface.add_polygon(p1, label=1)
```

Glue the edges of polygon 0 to the parallel edges of polygon 1.

```{code-cell}
surface.glue((0, 6), (1, 0))
surface.glue((0, 10), (1, 1))
surface.glue((0, 2), (1, 2))
```

Add three more rotated triangles and glue them appropriately.

```{code-cell}
for i in range(1, 4):
    surface.add_polygon((R**i) * p1, label=i + 1)
    surface.glue((0, 6 + i), (i + 1, 0))
    surface.glue((0, (10 + i) % 12), (i + 1, 1))
    surface.glue((0, 2 + i), (i + 1, 2))
```

Now we have a closed surface. In fact this is a translation surface:

```{code-cell}
surface
```

Once we are done building the surface, it is recommended to make the surface immutable. This lets sage-flatsurf figure out of which nature this surface is, e.g., that it is a translation surface. This speeds up many operations on the surface and makes it possible to compute things that are only defined or implemented for some types of surfaces:

```{code-cell}
surface.set_immutable()
surface
```

If you want to compute things, such as the stratum without making a surface immutable, please refer to the details in the documentation of the ``flatsurf.geometry.categories`` module in the module reference.

We can plot the surface. Edges are labeled according to the polygon they are glued to.

```{code-cell}
surface.plot()
```

The field containing the vertices:

```{code-cell}
surface.base_ring()
```

Computations in the Algebraic Real Field (AA) are slow. It is better to use a NumberField. The following finds a smaller number field::

```{code-cell}
vertices = [surface.polygon(p).vertex(v) for (p, v) in surface.edges()]
vertices = [vertex[0] for vertex in vertices] + [vertex[1] for vertex in vertices]
base_ring = Sequence(
    [coordinate.as_number_field_element()[1] for coordinate in vertices]
).universe()
ss = surface.change_ring(base_ring)
```

```{code-cell}
ss.base_ring()
```

## Getting a surface from Flipper

<a href="http://flipper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Flipper</a> is a program written by Mark Bell which understands mapping classes and can compute the flat structure associated to a pseudo-Anosov mapping class. FlatSurf can import this structure.

This code below requires flipper to be installed. You can do this by running the shell within sage:
<code>sage --sh</code>
Then within the shell execute:
<code>python -m pip install flipper --user --upgrade</code>
More information including pitfalls are described in <a href="http://flipper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/start.html#installation">Flipper's installation instructions</a>.

```{code-cell}
import flipper
```

```{code-cell}
T = flipper.load("SB_4")
```

```{code-cell}
h = T.mapping_class("s_0S_1s_2S_3s_1S_2")
```

```{code-cell}
h.is_pseudo_anosov()
```

```{code-cell}
s = translation_surfaces.from_flipper(h)
```

The surface s is actually a half translation surface

```{code-cell}
s
```

```{code-cell}
s.plot()
```

## From polyhedra

```{code-cell}
from flatsurf.geometry.polyhedra import platonic_dodecahedron

polyhedron, s, mapping = platonic_dodecahedron()
```

The surface $s$ is a Euclidean cone surface.

```{code-cell}
s
```

```{code-cell}
s.plot()
```

Sage has a built in polyhedron class. You can build a polyhedron as a convex hull of a list of vertices.

```{code-cell}
polyhedron = Polyhedron([(0, 0, 0), (1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), (0, 0, 1)])
```

```{code-cell}
polyhedron.plot()
```

The following computes the boundary surface as a Euclidean cone surface. It also provides a map from the surface to the polyhedron.

```{code-cell}
from flatsurf.geometry.polyhedra import polyhedron_to_cone_surface

s, mapping = polyhedron_to_cone_surface(polyhedron)
s
```

```{code-cell}
s.plot()
```

## Defining an infinite surface from scratch

Finite surfaces can be built by gluing polygons into a ``MutableOrientedSimilaritySurface``. For an infinite surface, we need to subclass ``OrientedSimilaritySurface`` and implement a few methods ourselves:

```{code-cell}
from flatsurf.geometry.surface import OrientedSimilaritySurface
from flatsurf.geometry.categories import TranslationSurfaces


class ParabolaSurface(OrientedSimilaritySurface):
    def __init__(self):
        # For finite surfaces, the category can be determined automotatically
        # but for infinite surfaces, we need to make an explicit choice here.
        super().__init__(
            QQ,
            category=TranslationSurfaces().InfiniteType().WithoutBoundary().Connected(),
        )

    def __repr__(self):
        r"""
        Return a printable representation of this surface.
        """
        return "ParabolaSurface()"

    def roots(self):
        r"""
        Return a label for each connected component of the surface.

        Iterating the polygons of the connected component starts at these labels.
        """
        return (1,)

    def is_mutable(self):
        r"""
        Return whether this surface can be modified by the user.
        """
        return False

    def is_compact(self):
        r"""
        Return whether this surface is a compact space.
        """
        return False

    def __eq__(self, other):
        r"""
        Return whether this surface is indistinguishable from ``other``.
        """
        return isinstance(other, ParabolaSurface)

    def __hash__(self):
        r"""
        Return a hash value for this surface that is compatible with ``__eq``.
        """
        return hash(type(self))

    def graphical_surface(self, **kwds):
        r"""
        Return a plottable representation of this surface.
        """
        graphical_surface = super().graphical_surface(**kwds)
        # Make the first six polygons of the surface visible by default when plotting.
        graphical_surface.make_all_visible(limit=6)
        return graphical_surface

    def polygon(self, label):
        r"""
        Return the polygon making up this surface labeled ``label``.
        """
        if label not in ZZ or label == 0:
            raise ValueError(f"invalid label {label}")

        if label < 0:
            return matrix(QQ, [[-1, 0], [0, -1]]) * self.polygon(-label)

        if label == 1:
            return Polygon(vertices=[(0, 0), (1, 1), (-1, 1)], base_ring=QQ)

        return Polygon(
            vertices=[
                (label - 1, (label - 1) ** 2),
                (label, label**2),
                (-label, label**2),
                (-label + 1, (label - 1) ** 2),
            ],
            base_ring=QQ,
        )

    def opposite_edge(self, label, e):
        if label not in ZZ or label == 0:
            raise ValueError(f"invalid label {label}")
        if label in [-1, 1] and e not in [0, 1, 2]:
            raise ValueError("no such edge")
        if e not in [0, 1, 2, 3]:
            raise ValueError("no such edge")

        if label in [-1, 1] and e == 1:
            return 2 * label, 3

        if e in [0, 2]:
            return -label, e

        if e == 1:
            return label + label.sign(), 3

        return label - label.sign(), 1
```

```{code-cell}
s = ParabolaSurface()
s
```

```{code-cell}
s.plot()
```

We can run a test suite to ensure that we have implemented everything that is needed to make this a fully functional surface.

```{code-cell}
TestSuite(s).run(verbose=True)
```
