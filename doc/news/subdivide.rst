**Added:**

* Added `Polygon.subdivide()`, `Surface.subdivide()`, and `SimilaritySurface.subdivide()` to subdivide polygons into triangles centered at the centroid of the convex polygons.

* Added `Polygon.subdivide_edges()`, `Surface.subdivide_edges()`, and `SimilaritySurface.subdivide_edges()` to add equally spaced marked points along the edges of polygons.

* Added `Polygon.centroid()` to compute the geometric center of polygons.
