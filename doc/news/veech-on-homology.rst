**Added:**

* Added ``VeechGroup`` and ``AffineAutomorphismGroup`` (also accessible as ``veech_gruop()`` and ``affine_automorphism_group()`` on surfaces.)

* Added ``apply_matrix`` to all oriented similarity surfaces. (We apply the matrix to all polygons and keep the gluings intact. Probably not the most meaningful operation for non-dilation surfaces but it can be useful while building surfaces.)

**Deprecated:**

* A polygon's ``circumscribing_circle()`` has been deprecated in favor of ``circumscribed_circle()``.
