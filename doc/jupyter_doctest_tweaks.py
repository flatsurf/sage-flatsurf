Sanitizes jupyter-sphinx cells in the documentation.

We use jupyter-execute to render plots in the module reference manual. At the
same time, we want to use these jupyter-execute blocks as doctests. However,
the sample output in these doctests cause syntax errors when passed to the
SageMath Jupyter kernel.

Here, we drop all lines that do not start with sage: or ....: so that the
Jupyter kernel can execute them.
